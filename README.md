# dont-look-back.nvim

## Introduction

*This was originally a fork of [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
and credit goes to them for helping others get started in the neovim journey.

## Prequisites
- This uses [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise) for the installation of required tools and setup commands.
For the most part mise supports both MacOS and Linux and is already part of majority of my workflows.
- neovim (can't forget it although I considered adding it to mise install)

## Install
```shell
mise run setup
```

## Start
Should be able to start neovim anywhere and everything will start to load.
```shell
nvim
```
